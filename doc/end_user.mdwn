# End-user documentation

Lintory is a Django based python application that aims to help keep track of
software licenses, license requirements, hardware, MAC addresses, users and
locations while supporting multiple OS, dual boot systems, and virtual
machines.

The software is currently alpha software. While it is in use at a medium
sized company, there is still much development work to be done to resolve
some of its [[developer/limitations]].

Regardless of the above, this page is aimed at end users of this
software.
